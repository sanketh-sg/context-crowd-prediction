## Context Crowd forecasting using Prophet


## Description
This project focuses on time series forecasting using "Prophet" time series model. It aims to predict the future people count based on historical data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/time-series-forecasting.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd time-series-forecasting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Data
The project uses historical data on people count, temperature, and other relevant variables. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to align timestamps.

## Models
The project implements several time series forecasting models, including Prophet and regression-based approaches. Each model is trained using historical data and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

* Sprint 1 contains model with default parameters that prophet offers.
* Sprint 2 contains model with parameters modified accordingly to fit the curve.
* Sprint 3 contains models that explains correlation between temp and people count.
